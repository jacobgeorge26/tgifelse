## tgifelse

_tgifelse_ is a social group at Unity. Members are given a weekly challenge to solve independently or collaboratively. These challenges vary in difficulty and are majority coding exercises, but occasionally a logic or mathematical problem.

Those participating in Brighton meet at the office Friday social to discuss the week's challenge, then code a solution.
